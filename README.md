# 🛡️ Ransomware-AD-RL: Detection & Automated Mitigation
## MSc Computer Science Research Project
This repository contains the research and implementation of a security framework designed to identify and respond to ransomware attacks within Active Directory (AD) environments. By combining the predictive power of Supervised Learning with the decision-making capabilities of Reinforcement Learning (RL), this project aims to close the gap between threat detection and automated incident response.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
Gap Analysis: Specifically addressing the lack of automated, real-time response mechanisms (mitigation) using Reinforcement Learning.

Active Directory Focus: Monitoring domain-specific attack vectors (e.g., Kerberoasting, DCShadow) and file-encryption patterns.

Dual-Model Approach: Supervised Learning: High-accuracy detection of known ransomware signatures and behavioral patterns.

Reinforcement Learning: Training agents to execute mitigation strategies (e.g., isolating nodes, killing processes, or revoking tokens) in a dynamic AD environment.
